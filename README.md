<h2>GitHub Stats Web Service</h2>

<p>This is a user-friendly web application that provides insightful statistics and information about GitHub repositories and user activity.</p>
<p>I decided to develop this app as part of my ALX Software Engineering Foundation portfolio project because of my interest in knowing the statistics associated with one's github account</p>
<p>GitHub Stats Web Service will empower developers with data-driven insights on GitHub repositories.</p>
