GitHub Stats Web Service

This is a user-friendly web application that provides insightful statistics and information about GitHub repositories and user activity.
I decided to develop this as part of my ALX Software Engineering project because I have always been interested in knowing the statistics associated with one's github account
GitHub Stats Web Service was born out of a passion for open-source software and the desire to empower developers with data-driven insights.
